**Phase 5 (Foundation & Reliability) context gathering is COMPLETE.**

We just finished `/gsd:discuss-phase 5` and captured all implementation decisions for:
1. Startup progress feedback
2. Auto-initialization behavior
3. Status dashboard scope
4. Error message format

The phase is ready for planning (`/gsd:plan-phase 5`).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**This Session (Milestone v1.1 Initialization):**

- ✅ Started milestone v1.1 Core UX Polish
- ✅ Ran 4 parallel research agents (Stack, Features, Architecture, Pitfalls)
- ✅ Synthesized research into SUMMARY_V11.md
- ✅ Defined 11 requirements across 5 categories
- ✅ Created 2-phase roadmap (Phase 5: Foundation, Phase 6: Navigation)
- ✅ Discussed Phase 5 and captured context

**Key Decisions Made:**

**Startup progress feedback:**
- Simple step-by-step with spinners
- Steps + final summary
- Helpful inline errors for common failures
- `--verbose` flag for debugging

**Auto-initialization behavior:**
- Block and show progress when databases missing
- Check every startup (fast skip if exists)
- Generic "Initializing database..." message
- Helpful errors with fix suggestions

**Status dashboard scope:**
- 4 metrics: Active workflows, Agent health, Recent errors, System resources
- Simple counts (no visual indicators)
- Periodic refresh
- On main page

**Error message format:**
- No error codes
- Include: description + resolution + collapsible technical details
- Details collapsed by default

**Previous Sessions (v1.0):**
- ✅ Completed Phase 1-4 (19 plans total)
- ✅ Shipped v1.0 Foundation milestone
- ✅ Completed ARCH-02 bidirectional registration (post-v1.0 work)

<remaining_work>

**Phase 5: Foundation & Reliability (3 plans):**
- [ ] 05-01: Single-command startup with ProcessManager
- [ ] 05-02: Auto-initialization with graceful degradation
- [ ] 05-03: Status dashboard and error handling

**Phase 6: Navigation & Onboarding (3 plans):**
- [ ] 06-01: Command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K) with fuzzy search
- [ ] 06-02: Quick search in navigation sideboards
- [ ] 06-03: Empty state guidance and onboarding

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**Milestone Scope (v1.1):**
- Focus on table stakes UX polish only (11 requirements)
- Differentiators (unified workspace, templates, live validation) deferred to v1.2+

**Phase 5 Approach:**
- Single command: `configurable-agents ui` (not `agents start`)
- Auto-init from ANY entry point: UI, CLI, Python API
- Zero new dependencies (Python multiprocessing + existing stack)
- Research-guided architecture from SUMMARY_V11.md

**Phase 5 Context:**
- Startup: simple, informative, `--verbose` mode
- Auto-init: block and show progress, helpful errors
- Status: 4 metrics, simple counts, periodic refresh
- Errors: description + resolution + collapsible details

</decisions_made>

<blockers>

**None.** All context gathering complete, research synthesized, roadmap created.

**Research gaps noted (to address during planning):**
- Gradio root_path behind reverse proxy (known bug in 4.21.0+)
- MLFlow auto-start from Python vs subprocess
- Windows multiprocessing quirks (spawn vs fork)

</blockers>

<context>

**Session Flow:**
1. User ran `/gsd:new-milestone UI/UX` → Gathers goals for v1.1
2. Questioning revealed: core UX polish only, focus on startup/initialization/navigation
3. Research first → 4 parallel agents → SUMMARY_V11.md
4. Requirements defined → 11 requirements, commit e096fd9
5. Roadmap created → 2 phases, commit d6ca869
6. Discuss Phase 5 → Context captured, commit 030ddc7
7. **Now** → Pause before planning

**Next Steps:**
- User can run `/gsd:plan-phase 5` to create first plan
- Or `/gsd:plan-phase 5 --skip-research` to plan immediately
- Research is complete, so skip-research not needed but available

**State of Planning Artifacts:**
- PROJECT.md: Updated with v1.1 goals
- REQUIREMENTS.md: 11 requirements across 5 categories
- ROADMAP.md: 2 phases (05: Foundation, 06: Navigation)
- STATE.md: Phase 5 ready to plan
- RESEARCH/: STACK.md, FEATURES_UX.md, ARCHITECTURE_V11.md, PITFALLS.md, SUMMARY_V11.md
- phases/05-foundation-reliability/05-CONTEXT.md: All implementation decisions captured

**Repository State:**
- Branch: main
- Last commit: 030ddc7 (Phase 5 context)
- Clean working directory

</context>

<next_action>

**To continue Phase 5 planning:**
```
/gsd:plan-phase 5
```

**To resume everything:**
```
/gsd:resume-work
```

**What to expect:**
- Phase 5 planning will spawn gsd-planner agent
- Planner will read CONTEXT.md, research, and create 05-01-PLAN.md
- Then execute via `/gsd:execute-phase 5`
