### Deferred Requirement (1/27)

| Requirement | Status | Reason | Impact |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| **ARCH-02**: Bidirectional registration | Deferred | Orchestrator-initiated registration deferred to post-v1 | Minor - agent-initiated works |

**Note:** ARCH-02 was originally a Phase 2 requirement but was deferred during Phase 2 planning and is not included in the v1.0 requirements traceability table. This is intentional, not a gap.

## Tech Debt

### Minor Items (3 total, all non-blocking)

**Phase 3:**
1. Gradio Chat UI not linked to Dashboard (UX improvement)
   - **Current:** Separate CLI commands (`configurable-agents chat` vs `configurable-agents dashboard`)
   - **Impact:** User must run two commands
   - **Recommendation:** Add "View in Dashboard" button in Gradio UI

2. Webhook workflow registration not automated (convenience feature)
   - **Current:** Manual workflow configuration required for webhook triggers
   - **Impact:** Extra configuration step
   - **Recommendation:** Add `POST /webhooks/register` endpoint to map webhooks to workflows

**Phase 4:**
3. Example YAML files need gates config format update (documentation only)
   - **Current:** Example files reference list format instead of GatesModel object
   - **Impact:** Documentation clarity only
   - **Recommendation:** Update example YAMLs to match actual schema

### Intentionally Deferred

**ARCH-02: Orchestrator-initiated registration**
- **Status:** Not in v1.0 requirements
- **Reason:** Agent-initiated registration sufficient for v1
- **Impact:** None - this is a post-v1 feature

## Code Quality

**No blocker anti-patterns detected:**
- No TODO/FIXME comments in production code
- No placeholder content or stub implementations
- All executors and tools have real implementations with error handling
- Security restrictions enforced (file path whitelisting, shell command whitelisting, SQL SELECT-only)

**Production readiness:**
- Error handling: Comprehensive try/except blocks throughout
- Logging: Structured logging with appropriate levels
- Type safety: Type hints throughout, mypy checks enabled
- Security: RestrictedPython for sandbox, HMAC verification for webhooks, input validation

## Blockers/Concerns

**None.**

All critical v1.0 requirements are satisfied. All E2E flows are complete. Cross-phase integration is excellent. Tech debt is minor and non-blocking.

## Next Steps

**Option A: Complete milestone** (Recommended)
- Accept current state as v1.0 complete
- Archive milestone and tag release
- Track tech debt in backlog for v1.1 or v2.0

**Option B: Address tech debt first**
- Fix Gradio → Dashboard link
- Implement webhook workflow registration
- Update example YAMLs
- Then complete milestone

**Option C: Extend milestone**
- Implement ARCH-02 (orchestrator-initiated registration)
- Add authentication/authorization
- Production hardening

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Option A (Complete milestone). The platform is production-ready for local-first, single-user/team deployments. Tech debt items are UX improvements that can be addressed in v1.1 without blocking v1.0 release.
