# Project Handoff - v1.0 Shipped

## Current Position

**Milestone:** v1.0 Foundation — **SHIPPED** ✅
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Ready to plan v1.1

No active phase or plan in progress. All v1.0 work is complete and archived.

## What Was Completed (v1.0)

**All 4 phases shipped:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Core Engine (4 plans) — Multi-LLM, control flow, storage abstraction
- ✅ Phase 2: Agent Infrastructure (6 plans) — Registry, observability, CLI
- ✅ Phase 3: Interfaces & Triggers (6 plans) — Chat UI, dashboard, webhooks
- ✅ Phase 4: Advanced Capabilities (3 plans) — Sandboxes, memory, tools, optimization

**Total:** 19 plans, 27/27 requirements satisfied, 1,018+ tests (98%+ pass rate)

## Milestone Archives

All v1.0 artifacts are archived in `.planning/milestones/`:
- `v1.0-ROADMAP.md` — Full phase details and plans
- `v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md` — All requirements marked complete
- `v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` — Audit report (27/27 requirements, 24/24 integrations)
- `MILESTONES.md` — High-level milestone summary

## Updated Files

**Planning docs:**
- `ROADMAP.md` — Collapsed to one-line entry with link to archive
- `PROJECT.md` — All requirements moved to Validated, Current State section added
- `STATE.md` — Reset for next milestone
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — Deleted (archived, fresh one needed for v1.1)

**Git:**
- Tagged: `v1.0`
- Committed: `e2bb078` (chore: complete v1.0 milestone)
- Pushed to GitHub: main, dev, gsd branches all synced

## Next Steps

**To start v1.1 planning:**

```bash
/gsd:new-milestone
```

This will:
1. Ask questions about next milestone goals
2. Spawn researchers for domain exploration
3. Create fresh REQUIREMENTS.md for v1.1
4. Update ROADMAP.md with new phases
5. Reset STATE.md for new milestone

**Or if you want to:**
- Review v1.0: Check `.planning/milestones/v1.0-*` files
- Add todos: `/gsd:add-todo` to capture ideas before planning
- Audit milestone: `/gsd:audit-milestone v1.0` (already passed)

## Project Context

**Platform:** Local-first, config-driven agent orchestration
**Core Value:** Zero cloud lock-in, config-first, observable by design
**Tech Stack:** Python, LangGraph, FastAPI, Gradio, HTMX, MLFlow

**What v1.0 delivers:**
- Multi-LLM support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama)
- Advanced control flow (branching, loops, parallel)
- Complete observability (MLFlow, cost tracking, profiling)
- User interfaces (Chat UI, Dashboard)
- External integrations (WhatsApp, Telegram, webhooks)
- Advanced capabilities (sandboxes, memory, tools, A/B optimization)

## Blockers/Issues

**None.** v1.0 shipped cleanly with no outstanding blockers.

## Resume Action

When ready to continue:

**Option 1: Start v1.1 milestone**
```bash
/gsd:new-milestone
```

**Option 2: Capture ideas first**
```bash
/gsd:add-todo
```

**Option 3: Review progress**
```bash
/gsd:progress
```
