## Current State

**Task**: CLEANUP AND VERIFICATION (ONGOING)
**Phase**: Restoration
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS

### ALERT

**THE CURRENT PROJECT STATE IS BROKEN. THERE IS AN ONGOING CLEANUP AND VERIFICATION.**

After introducing an autonomous agent system post-v1.0, the codebase and documentation
became inconsistent and out of sync. We are currently:

1. Verifying actual project state vs documentation
2. Cleaning up discrepancies between docs and code
3. Restoring consistent documentation methodology
4. Re-establishing proper commit workflow

**Details will be added to docs as available under:**
`docs/implementation_logs/`

### What I Was Doing

Restoring project to a clean, verifiable state after autonomous agent caused
documentation and codebase discrepancies. Git shows many deleted doc files
and unknown current state.

### Next Steps

1. [ ] Verify current codebase state matches documentation
2. [ ] Clean up any remaining discrepancies
3. [ ] Update all documentation to reflect actual state
4. [ ] Verify tests pass
5. [ ] Create implementation log for cleanup work

### Blockers

- Unknown: Need to verify what actually works vs what docs say
